# From assistant to notebooks

In this session we will learn how to create jupyter notebooks out of the workflows we created in the session [How to build an analysis workflow](../20_How_to_build_an_analysis_workflow/Readme.md).

Outline of this session:

* exporting a clij workflow from Fiji to a jupyter notebook
* export a napari assistant workflow to a jupyter notebook
* use the created notebooks to document our image analysis workflow
* cover python programming basics needed to adapt an analysis workflow:
  * variables
  * loops
  * opening image files
  * saving image files and pandas tables
  * (optional) functions
* adapt an analysis workflow to apply it to a whole folder of images
* (optional) adapt a workflow to explore a range of parameters

If you would like to reproduce what we show on your own computer, follow [this blog post](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html) to install the necessary software.
