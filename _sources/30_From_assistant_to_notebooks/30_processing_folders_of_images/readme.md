# Processing folders of images

In this section, we will explain how to work with file paths in Python. We will show a few folder structure examples and how to navigate through them via code. this is important when planning batch processing. It is also good data management practice to have a standardized folder structure to store images for sharing.

We will then customize an exported workflow notebook such that it processes a whole folder
